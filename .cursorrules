# Project Rules and Conventions

## Task Management with Mise

### Running tasks from project root
When running `mise` commands from the project root (`/Users/dzlk/Dev/neskuchka/`), you must use prefixes:
- `mise run //frontend:checks --fix`
- `mise run //backend:checks`
- `mise run //frontend:tests`

### Running tasks from subdirectories
When running `mise` commands from within a specific directory (e.g., `frontend/` or `backend/`), you can omit the prefix:
- `cd frontend/` then `mise run checks --fix`
- `cd backend/` then `mise run tests`

### Best practices
- Always prefer using `mise` over direct tool calls (`pnpm`, `go`, etc.)
- Use `mise run //frontend:checks --fix` to automatically fix formatting issues before committing
- The project has pre-commit hooks that run checks, so ensure formatting is correct before committing

## Project Structure
- This is a monorepo with `backend/` (Go) and `frontend/` (TypeScript/React)
- Each part has its own tasks defined in mise configuration
- Pre-commit hooks run checks automatically
